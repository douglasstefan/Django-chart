Weather Display
===============

This page is a small, HTML- and JS-only, website to show basic weather information for a sailing spot in southern germany.

## API Key

The API key must be provided using the URL hash, like

    index.html#!abcdef

## Custom Position

When using this site for any other spot, please set the `position` argument in the URL:

    index.html#!abcdef?position=41.145556,-73.995

Please note that this will not change the rain and lightning maps as they are
a bit of a hack and not using proper slippy maps.

## Query String Format

Alternatively the API key may be given as an named argument:

    index.html#!apikey=abcdef?position=41.145556,-73.995

Any query string delimiter like

    index.html#abcdef
    index.html#!abcdef
    index.html?abcdef

is possible.

## Example

An example of this site can be found on <http://nils-werner.github.io/owm-display/>

Obviously you need to provide your own [API key](https://developer.forecast.io/).
